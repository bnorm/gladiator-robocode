This project is provided as an open source project because the author was once a beginner as well. Yet, because this
project is the result of many hours of hard work, the author would like a little credit for his toil.

All the author asks is that any original work or ideas used that are found within this project be referenced as such.
A simple link back to this project website would be adequate. Thank you for your consideration on this matter.
