 * Title: DeltaSixTwo, RC-1262, AKA 'Scorch'
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Description: War does funny things to people. Similarly, some people do funny things with war. Six-Two is the Delta's
 * resident wiseacre, regularly dropping a world-weary bon mot into the stew of violence and destruction that serves as
 * the Deltas' steady diet. A competent soldier, and an excellent explosives technician, Six-Two has an overdeveloped
 * sense of irony that could be mistaken for fatalism. 'Scorch' earned his nickname after an ordnance accident that left
 * him and Sergeant Walon Vau without eyebrows for a short time.
